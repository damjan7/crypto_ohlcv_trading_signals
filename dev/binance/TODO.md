# Base Trainer Trading System TODOs

## Tree Models to evaluate interactions between variables

## Create Backtesting Engine
- Create a backtesting engine that can run on historical data
- Implement a trading strategy that can be backtested
- Add visualization tools for backtesting results
- Add transaction costs to backtesting results
- Long Short Strategy

## Create a Trading Signal Generator
- Implement a trading signal generator that can be used to generate trading signals for the backtesting engine
- takes signals from signal generator and combines them into a single signal (buy, sell, hold)
- should take cross sectional data as input (for a number of different asset pairs)
- signal generator may also output a "probability" or "confidence" score and hence a bet size.

## Analyze Features/Create new Features
- look at predictive performance of single features on the future returns
- correlation plots between features
- correlation plots between features and future returns

## Model Improvements
- Add more sophisticated trading metrics like Sortino ratio and Calmar ratio
- Implement position sizing logic in trading metrics calculation
- Add transaction costs to trading metrics
- Create backtesting visualization tools

## Feature Engineering
- Add feature selection methods
- Implement feature importance visualization
- Add correlation analysis for features

## Model Training
- Add early stopping functionality
- Implement model versioning
- Add cross-validation with different time windows
- Create ensemble methods combining multiple models

## Performance Optimization
- Add parallel processing for cross-validation
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- Add progress bars for long-running operations

## Documentation
- Add docstrings for all methods
- Create usage examples
- Document trading metrics calculations

## Testing
- Add unit tests for trading metrics
- Create integration tests
- Add data validation tests
