- data update process; to check if and how it works (i.e., is it automatic with the package or not? What happens if Tickers get delisted? What happens if tickers get listed?)

- maybe makes more sense to save the whole data pipeline in a long-format? or not? Or a wide format but instead of "per asset" save it "per element", i.e. a df for each col (volume, high, low, ...)
